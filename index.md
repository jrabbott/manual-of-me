# Manual of Me

Welcome to my Manual of Me. This site is a guide to how I think, work, and collaborate.

It is built around a simple mantra: **"This is me. I'm trying to change. I need your help."**

## Hi, I'm Jon

I am a determined, goal-oriented individual with a strong sense of purpose. In Facet5 terminology, my working style is that of a **Producer**.

I have a **"Spiky Profile."** My brain is wired to process information globally rather than sequentially. This means I perform at a high level in strategic, visual, and "big picture" reasoning, but I encounter specific friction with linear administrative tasks and converting my ideas into written text.

* **This is me:** I am a strategic, "Big Picture" thinker who spots patterns instantly.
* **I'm trying to change:** I am working on bridging the gap between my high verbal fluency and my written output.
* **I need your help:** I need opportunities to verbalize complex ideas and patience with the mechanics of my writing.
