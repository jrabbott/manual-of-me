# Hi, I'm Jon

I am a delivery-focused person who likes to solve difficult problems. I care about setting clear goals and getting the job done efficiently.

My brain works a little differently. I have a **"Spiky Profile."** This means I am excellent at strategic thinking and seeing the "big picture," but I find linear tasks like writing and checking details harder.

* **This is me:** I am an independent thinker who uses evidence to make decisions.
* **I'm trying to change:** I am learning to slow down and explain my ideas clearly, rather than rushing to the finish line.
* **I need your help:** I need to talk through complex problems rather than writing them down.

## Too Long; Didn't Read (TLDR)
If you only read one thing, read this:

* **How I work:** I focus on outcomes. I spot patterns instantly, but I find processing long text difficult.
* **How to talk to me:** Be direct and honest. I value data and logic over opinion.
* **How to message me:** Keep Slack messages short. One topic per message. If it is complex, put it in a document and share the link.
* **How I fit in:** I am independent and happy to lead. I prefer doing the work over "forced fun".
