# Manual of Me

Welcome to my Manual of Me — a guide to how I think, work, communicate, and collaborate.  

This site helps others understand how to work effectively with me and how I do my best work.

## Hi, I'm Jon

I am a determined and goal-oriented individual with a strong sense of purpose. In Facet5 terminology, my working style is that of a **Producer**.

I am driven by results, efficiency, and the successful completion of tasks. I approach my work with high energy for the task at hand, but I am pragmatic and business-focused in my relationships.

* **My Core Style:** Independent, determined, and structured.
* **My Drive:** I am ambitious and motivated by achieving measurable targets.
* **My Approach:** I value logic, data, and clear planning over abstract ideas or emotional appeals.
