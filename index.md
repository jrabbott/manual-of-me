# Manual of Me

Welcome to my Manual of Me. This guide helps you understand how I think and work.

It is built around three simple sentences: **"This is me. I'm trying to change. I need your help."**

## Hi, I'm Jon

I am a determined person who likes to set clear goals. I like to get things done efficiently.

My brain works a little differently. I have a **"Spiky Profile."** This means I am very good at some things (like seeing the big picture), but I find other things hard (like writing and checking small details).

* **This is me:** I am an independent thinker who spots patterns quickly.
* **I'm trying to change:** I am learning to be patient when I have to explain my ideas in writing.
* **I need your help:** I need chances to talk about my ideas instead of just writing them down.
