# Hi, I'm Jon

I am a determined person who likes to set clear goals. I like to get things done efficiently.

My brain works a little differently. I have a **"Spiky Profile."** This means I am very good at some things (like seeing the big picture), but I find other things hard (like writing and checking small details).

* **This is me:** I am an independent thinker who spots patterns quickly.
* **I'm trying to change:** I am learning to be patient when I have to explain my ideas in writing.
* **I need your help:** I need chances to talk about my ideas instead of just writing them down.

## Too Long; Didn't Read (TLDR)
If you only read one thing, read this:

* **How I work:** I focus on results. I see the "big picture" instantly, but I find reading and writing long text difficult.
* **How to talk to me:** Be direct and honest. I like facts and logic. If I seem intense, it is just because I care about the work.
* **How to message me:** Keep Slack messages short. One topic per message. If you have a lot to write, put it in a document and send me a link.
* **How I fit in:** I am independent and like to lead. I prefer working hard over "forced fun".
