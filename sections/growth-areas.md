# Growth Areas

I am aware of my potential blind spots and actively work on them.

* **Inflexibility:** Once I am set on a course, I can be stubborn and rigid. I may find it hard to adapt quickly if a plan changes suddenly.
* **Impatience:** Because I am driven and result-oriented, I can be demanding and unyielding. I may tread on others' toes in my pursuit of goals.
* **Being "too" direct:** I am blunt and tough-minded. I realize this can sometimes be perceived by others as unsympathetic or overly critical.
* **Worrying:** My profile suggests high emotionality, which means I can be prone to worrying and double-checking to avoid errors. I may sometimes appear pessimistic or overly cautious.
