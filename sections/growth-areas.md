# Growth Areas

## "I'm trying to change"

I am managing my **"Spiky Profile"**—balancing my high-level strategic skills with the friction of daily tasks.

* **The "Idea Flood":** I often have more ideas than I can capture. I am working on better systems to record these without getting overwhelmed or losing the thread.
* **Inflexibility:** Once I am set on a course, I can be stubborn and rigid. I am trying to be more open to adapting when plans change.
* **Impatience:** Because I see the "whole" immediately, I can get impatient with the step-by-step explanation. I am trying to slow down for others.
* **Delivery:** I am naturally blunt and tough-minded. I realize this can be perceived as unsympathetic, and I am working on my delivery.
