# Growth Areas

## "I'm trying to change"
I am committed to continuous improvement. I am learning to manage my "Spiky Profile" better.

### What I am working on
* **Capturing ideas:** Sometimes I have too many ideas to track. I am learning better ways to record them so I don't get overwhelmed.
* **Flexibility:** Once I have a plan, I can be stubborn. I am trying to be more open to changing direction when the evidence changes.
* **Patience:** Because I see the solution quickly, I can get impatient. I am learning to slow down and bring the team with me.
* **Trusting intent:** I can sometimes be suspicious of motives. I am trying to start from a place of trust.
* **Tone of voice:** I am naturally direct. I know this can sound blunt. I am working on delivering feedback more softly.
