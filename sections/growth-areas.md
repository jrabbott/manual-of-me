# Growth Areas

## "I'm trying to change"

I am learning to handle my **"Spiky Profile"**—balancing my big ideas with the everyday tasks I find tricky.

* **Too many ideas:** Sometimes I have so many ideas I can't catch them all. I am learning better ways to record them so I don't get overwhelmed.
* **Being stubborn:** Once I decide on a plan, I can be stuck in my ways. I am trying to be more open to changing my mind.
* **Being impatient:** Because I see the answer immediately, I can get impatient when others need it explained step-by-step. I am trying to slow down.
* **Trusting people:** Sometimes I can be suspicious of why people are doing things. I am trying to trust that people mean well.
* **How I speak:** I am naturally direct and tough. I know this can sometimes sound unkind. I am trying to say things more gently.
