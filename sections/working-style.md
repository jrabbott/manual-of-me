# Working Style

* **Environment:** I prefer a professional, business-like environment. I struggle with loud, casual, or disorganized workplaces.
* **Focus:** I am task-oriented and keen to achieve measurable results. I focus more intensely as deadlines or events get close.
* **Structure:** I like order, structure, and planning. I prefer to think ahead rather than reacting spontaneously.
* **Pace:** I am energetic and active in the pursuit of my goals, but I am also cautious and will double-check work to avoid errors.
