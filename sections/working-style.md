# Working Style

## "This is me"

I like to see the **"Big Picture."** While many people look at things one step at a time (A, then B, then C), I usually see the whole thing at once.

### The "Spiky Profile"
I have Dyslexia. This affects how I think. Imagine a chart of my skills. Instead of a flat line, mine looks like huge spikes:

* **My Superpowers (The High Spikes):**
    * Making big plans and strategy.
    * Solving hard problems instantly.
    * Understanding people and "reading the room."

* **My Hard Tasks (The Low Dips):**
    * Memorizing lists of facts.
    * Reading long documents quickly.
    * Spelling and writing.

### What you can expect
* **I see the goal:** I can see the end result clearly and the best path to get there. I am good at spotting mistakes in big plans instantly.
* **I focus on results:** I want to finish the job. I care more about the result than the small steps needed to get there.
* **I like freedom:** I am organized, but I need to choose my own way of working.

### What you might not know
* **I connect dots:** I can link ideas that seem totally different. I often play out a situation in my head to see if it works before I write anything down.
* **I worry inside:** I might look confident, but I worry about making mistakes. I check things many times because I care about getting it right.
