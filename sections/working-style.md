# Working Style

- I’m focused, thoughtful, and intentional about my work.
- I stay calm under pressure and make rational decisions.
- I enjoy structure but stay flexible when things change.
- I like breaking complex problems into manageable steps.
- I prefer clarity over speed — getting it right matters.
