# Working Style

## "This is me"
I focus on the outcome. While some people work through a process step-by-step, I tend to see the whole system at once.

### The "Spiky Profile"
I have Dyslexia. This is a different way of processing information. Imagine a chart of my skills.



Instead of a flat line, my skills look like spikes:

* **My Superpowers (The High Spikes):**
    * Building strategy and vision.
    * Solving complex service problems instantly.
    * Reading people and understanding team dynamics.

* **My Hard Tasks (The Low Dips):**
    * Memorising lists of facts.
    * Reading long documents quickly.
    * Spelling and writing mechanics.

### What you can expect
* **I spot the gaps:** I can see where a plan might fail before we start. I focus on managing risks to ensure we deliver.
* **I am pragmatic:** I care about what works. I focus on tangible results rather than theory.
* **I am organised:** I like structure and planning, but I need the autonomy to define the method myself.

### What you might not know
* **I connect the dots:** I often simulate a scenario in my head to test if it works before I write anything down.
* **I worry about quality:** I might look confident, but I worry about making mistakes. I check things carefully because I care about the standard of our work.
