# Working Style

## "This is me"

I operate with a **"Big Picture"** mindset. While many process information step-by-step (A → B → C), I tend to see the whole system immediately.

### The "Spiky Profile"
I have Dyslexia, which is a distinct cognitive processing style. A useful way to visualize this is that while a neurotypical brain has a flat profile of average skills, my profile is "Spiky":
* **The Spikes (My Superpowers):** Strategic vision, complex problem solving, lateral thinking, and high empathy.
* **The Dips (My Friction Points):** Rote memorization, processing speed, linear administrative tasks, and writing mechanics.

### What you can expect
* **Strategic Vision:** I can visualize the end goal and the path to get there, often spotting gaps or flaws in complex systems instantly.
* **Driven by Results:** I am ambitious and goal-oriented. I focus on the outcome rather than the minute administrative steps required to get there.
* **Structure & Autonomy:** I am personally organized and planned, but I need the freedom to define my own methods.

### What you might not know
* **Interconnected Reasoning:** I make intuitive leaps between seemingly unrelated topics. I often "simulate" scenarios in my mind to see where they break before I ever put pen to paper.
* **Dynamic Problem Solving:** Because standard linear methods can be obstacles for me, I have developed unique workarounds and am a master of simplification and efficiency.
* **Internal Worry:** Despite my confident exterior, my high emotionality means I worry about outcomes and double-check risks constantly.
