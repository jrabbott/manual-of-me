# Communication

## "This is me"

There is a big difference between how I talk and how I write.

### What you can expect
* **I talk well:** I am good at explaining big ideas out loud. I enjoy a good discussion or debate.
* **I am direct:** I like to keep things short and clear. I get straight to the point.
* **I use facts:** I like logic and proof. I listen to facts more than feelings.

### What you might not know
* **Writing is hard:** I often have more ideas in my head than I can write down. I can explain it perfectly when I speak, but it is harder to get it on paper.
* **I can get lost:** If I have to write a long story or report, I might lose track of what I am saying. I prefer bullet points and chatting instead of writing long emails.
* **I need time:** It takes me longer to read and understand complex writing. I work best when I can see a picture of the idea or talk about it.
* **I read the room:** Because I sometimes miss words, I have learned to be very good at reading body language and feelings.
