# Communication

My communication style is direct, formal, and concise.

* **Be brief and direct:** I appreciate concise expression. Please get to the point—I prefer you to know what you want to say before approaching me.
* **Use logic and facts:** I am pragmatic and data-driven. I respect arguments based on business logic and "expert" opinion rather than emotional appeals.
* **Expect robust debate:** I express my views forcefully and enjoy open discussion and argument. If I challenge you, it is because I am engaged, not because I am being difficult.
* **Formal is fine:** I often use a formal communication style and prefer relationships to be kept business-like.
