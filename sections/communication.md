# Communication

## "This is me"

There is a big difference between how I talk and how I write.

### What you can expect
* **I talk well:** I am good at explaining big ideas out loud. I enjoy a good discussion or debate.
* **I am direct:** I like to keep things short and clear. I get straight to the point.
* **I use facts:** I like logic and proof. I listen to facts more than feelings.
* **I am intense, not angry:** I care deeply about the work. If I get loud or excited, it is because I am passionate about the result. It does not mean I am angry at you.

### What you might not know
* **Writing is hard:** I often have more ideas in my head than I can write down. I can explain it perfectly when I speak, but it is harder to get it on paper.
* **I can get lost:** If I have to write a long story or report, I might lose track of what I am saying. I prefer bullet points and chatting instead of writing long emails.
* **I need time:** It takes me longer to read and understand complex writing. I work best when I can see a picture of the idea or talk about it.

### How to say "No" to me
I have strong opinions and I fight for them. This can sometimes make people scared to disagree with me. Please know that I respect people who stand up to me with facts.

* **Don't:** Stay silent or agree just to keep the peace.
* **Do:** Say, "Jon, I disagree. Here is the reason why."
