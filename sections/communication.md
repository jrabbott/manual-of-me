# Communication

## "This is me"
I value clarity and honesty. There is often a difference between how I speak and how I write.

### What you can expect
* **I articulate ideas well:** I am good at explaining complex concepts out loud. I enjoy a robust, evidence-based discussion.
* **I am direct:** I respect your time, so I keep things short and to the point.
* **I rely on evidence:** I make decisions based on logic and data. I listen to facts more than emotional appeals.
* **I am intense, not angry:** I am passionate about delivery. If I get animated, it is because I care about the result, not because I am upset with you.

### What you might not know
* **Writing creates friction:** I often have more ideas than I can write down effectively. I can explain the strategy perfectly in a call, but might struggle to type it out.
* **I prefer conversation:** I work best when we can look at a problem together, rather than sending long emails back and forth.
* **I need processing time:** It takes me longer to digest dense written information.

### How to say "No" to me
I have strong views and I advocate for them. This can sometimes make it hard to challenge me. Please know that I respect colleagues who challenge me with evidence.

* **Don't:** Stay silent if you think I am wrong.
* **Do:** Say, "Jon, I disagree. Here is the evidence why."
