# Communication

## "This is me"

There is a significant difference between my verbal and written skills.

### What you can expect
* **Verbal Fluency:** I articulate complex ideas well in conversation. I am good at forceful discussion and open debate.
* **Directness:** I appreciate concise expression and get straight to the point.
* **Logic over Emotion:** I am pragmatic and rely on facts, data, and logic rather than emotional appeals.

### What you might not know
* **The "Written Gap":** I often have more ideas than I can write down. My ideas may be fully formed verbally, but I can struggle to capture that same clarity on paper.
* **Losing the Thread:** When writing long pieces of work, I can lose the "thread" of the narrative. I prefer bullet points and conversation over long-form prose.
* **Processing Delay:** I need time to digest dense written information. I process best when I can visualize the concept or discuss it.
* **High Empathy:** Because I sometimes struggle to process verbal instructions quickly, I have developed a heightened ability to "read the room" and understand non-verbal cues.
