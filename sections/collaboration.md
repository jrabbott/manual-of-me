# Collaboration

* **Asking for help:** I know what I am bad at. I am good at asking others to handle the reading or writing tasks so I can focus on strategy and problem-solving.
* **Working alone:** I am happy working by myself. I prefer to be independent rather than relying on a big team for everything.
* **Leading:** I am good at taking charge and helping a group agree on a plan.
* **Socializing:** Too much socializing makes me tired. I prefer work to be about work, rather than "forced fun."
