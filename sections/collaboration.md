# Collaboration

* **Delegation:** I am acutely aware of my weaknesses. I excel at delegating administrative or linear tasks so I can focus on my "zone of genius"—strategy and problem-solving.
* **Independence:** I am comfortable working alone. I often prefer to work independently rather than in a dependent team role.
* **Leadership:** I provide a strong leadership position and focus people on an agreed way forward.
* **Socializing:** I find "very social" team environments draining. I prefer professional relationships over "forced fun".
