# Collaboration

My collaboration style is defined by independence and a focus on the task.

* **I am an independent worker:** I am comfortable working alone and prepared to "go it alone" if necessary. I often prefer to work independently rather than in a dependent team role.
* **I value competence:** I am conscientious and loyal, and I work best with others who share my views on duty and responsibility. I can be intolerant of people who do not "fit" or who lack discipline.
* **I am private:** I am naturally reserved and take time to get to know people. I prefer professional relationships over "forced fun" or highly social team environments.
* **I lead from the front:** In a group, I tend to provide a strong leadership position and have firm ideas on how things should be done.
