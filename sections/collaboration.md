# Collaboration

## "This is me"
I am independent and delivery-focused. I work best when I have clear goals and autonomy.

### What you can expect
* **I work autonomously:** I am comfortable picking up a task and running with it. I prefer independence over being managed closely.
* **I lead the way:** I am happy to take responsibility and help the team agree on a way forward.
* **I ask for support:** I know my blind spots. I am good at asking others to help with detailed writing tasks so I can focus on strategy and problem-solving.

### What you might not know
* **I need clear boundaries:** I enjoy professional relationships, but I find "forced fun" draining. I prefer to bond over doing good work together.
* **I prefer small groups:** Large meetings can be overwhelming if they lack structure. I prefer smaller, focused working groups.
