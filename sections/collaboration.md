# Collaboration

* **Asking for support:** I know my blind spots. I am good at asking others to help with detailed writing tasks so I can focus on strategy and problem-solving.
* **Working autonomously:** I am comfortable picking up a task and running with it. I prefer independence over being managed closely.
* **Leading the way:** I am happy to take responsibility and help the team agree on a way forward.
* **Socialising:** I enjoy professional relationships, but I find "forced fun" draining. I prefer to bond over doing good work together.
