# Strengths

## "This is me"
My strengths lie in strategic thinking, resilience, and delivery.

### Key Strengths
* **Pattern Recognition:** I can spot trends in data or user behaviour that others might miss.
* **Simplification:** Because complex text is hard for me, I am great at making things simple and accessible. I look for the most efficient way to solve a problem.
* **Determination:** When I set a goal, I am committed to achieving it. I drive projects through to completion.
* **Visual Reasoning:** I often think in pictures or workflows. This helps me design creative solutions to service problems.
* **Resilience:** I am willing to take risks to get the right result. I am not afraid of failing if we learn from it.
