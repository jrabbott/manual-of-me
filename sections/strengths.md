# Strengths

My strengths are **thinking differently** and **getting things done**.

* **Spotting Patterns:** I can see patterns in information or behavior that other people might miss.
* **Making it simple:** Because reading and writing takes a lot of energy for me, I am great at making things simple. I always look for the fastest, easiest way to explain something.
* **Determination:** When I set a goal, I stick to it. I work hard to finish projects.
* **Thinking in pictures:** I don't always think in words. I think in pictures or movies in my head. This helps me solve problems in creative ways.
* **Bouncing back:** I have had to work hard to learn things that are easy for others. This has made me strong and willing to take risks. I am not afraid of failing.
