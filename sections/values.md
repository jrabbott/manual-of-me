# Values

I am driven by wanting to **lead** and **do things well**.

* **Influence:** I like to be in charge and have difficult challenges. I want to make a difference.
* **Efficiency:** I like doing things the right way without wasting time. I like systems that make hard problems simple.
* **Rewards:** I like to be rewarded when I do a good job.
* **Results:** I care about real results, not just ideas. I want to see that my work actually worked.
