# Values

My work preferences are driven by **Power** and **Process**.

* **Influence:** I am motivated by the ability to influence events and people. I want to feel I am in charge and being challenged.
* **Efficiency:** I place great emphasis on doing things properly. I prefer efficient systems that allow me to simplify complex problems.
* **Meritocracy:** I value being materially rewarded for my achievements.
* **Results:** I am motivated by producing measurable results rather than abstract concepts.
