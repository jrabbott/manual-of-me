# Values

## "This is me"
I am driven by impact, doing things properly, and seeing real-world results.

### Core Values
* **Influence:** I want to make a real difference to the service and the team.
* **Efficiency:** I value doing things the right way. I like systems that make hard problems simple.
* **Recognition:** I value being recognised for delivering a good job.
* **Outcomes:** I care about real-world results, not just theory. I want to see that our work has worked.
* **Professionalism:** I respect expertise and ethical behaviour.
