# How to support me

## "I need your help"

To help me do my best work, I need these things from you:

* **Let me talk it out:** If I am struggling to write something, let me tell you about it instead. I can usually speak the answer faster than I can type it.
* **Look at the idea, not the spelling:** Please ignore my spelling mistakes. Focus on the big idea I am sharing.
* **Let me do it my way:** I don't like being watched too closely. Give me the goal and let me find the best way to get there.
* **Use pictures:** If you can, explain things using diagrams, videos, or short lists. Please don't give me huge walls of text.
* **Be honest:** I like the truth. If I missed a small detail because I was looking at the big picture, just tell me.
