# How to support me

## "I need your help"

To help me do my best work, I need the following from you:

* **Let me talk it out:** If I am struggling to write something down, let me explain it verbally. I can often "speak" the solution faster than I can type it.
* **Focus on the idea, not the spelling:** Please look past typos or grammar structure to the core strategic idea I am presenting.
* **Grant me autonomy:** I resist close management. Give me the goal and let me find my own efficient path to it.
* **Use visuals:** Where possible, explain things using diagrams, videos, or bullet points rather than walls of text.
* **Direct Feedback:** I prefer honesty. If I have missed a detail because I was looking at the big picture, tell me directly.
