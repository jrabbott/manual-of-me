# How to support me

## "I need your help"

To help me do my best work, I need these things from you:

* **Let me talk it out:** If I am struggling to write something, let me tell you about it instead. I can usually speak the answer faster than I can type it.
* **Look at the idea, not the spelling:** Please ignore my spelling mistakes. Focus on the big idea I am sharing.
* **Let me do it my way:** I don't like being watched too closely. Give me the goal and let me find the best way to get there.
* **Be honest:** I like the truth. If I missed a small detail because I was looking at the big picture, just tell me.

### Tools that help me
Reading long text in chat is hard for me. Please use these rules:
* **One topic per message:** Keep Slack messages focused on one thing. My brain creates many ideas from just one topic, so a mix of topics is hard to process.
* **Bullet points:** Use simple lists. Do not write long paragraphs.
* **Links, not long posts:** If you have a lot to say (like meeting notes or a big update), put it in a separate document and send me the link. Please do not paste long text into Slack.
