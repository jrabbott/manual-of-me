# How to support me

To get the best out of me, the following approaches work well:

* **Grant me autonomy:** I resist close management. Provide me with specific goals, but allow me the freedom to decide *how* to achieve them].
* **Give direct feedback:** I prefer honesty, but ensure you have your facts straight. Be prepared for me to defend my position if criticized.
* **Allow me to save face:** If I have made a mistake, tell me directly but privately. Allow me the dignity to correct it myself without public embarrassment.
* **Offer reassurance:** despite my confident exterior, my high emotionality means I can lack confidence and may need support and encouragement.
* **Don't force socialization:** I find "very social" team environments draining. Respect my need for privacy.
