# How to support me

## "I need your help"
To help me deliver my best work, I need clear communication and the right tools.

### What I need from you
* **Let me talk it out:** If I am blocked on a written task, a five-minute chat is often all I need to unblock it.
* **Focus on the value:** Please ignore my spelling mistakes. Focus on the strategic idea I am sharing.
* **Trust me to deliver:** I do not like being micromanaged. Agree the goal with me, then trust me to find the way.
* **Be honest:** I value truth. If I missed a detail because I was looking at the big picture, please tell me directly.

### Tools that help me
Reading long text in Slack is a barrier for me. Please use these formats:
* **One topic per message:** Keep Slack messages focused on a single thing.
* **Bullet points:** Use simple lists to break up information.
* **Links over long posts:** If you have a lot to share (like meeting notes), put it in an accessible document and send me the link. Please do not paste walls of text into chat.
